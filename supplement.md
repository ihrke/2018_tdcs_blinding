# Supplemental Analyses

## Technical details for Bayesian analyses

All Bayesian analyses used four independent chains with 2000 samples each. We treated the first 1000 iterations as warm-up phase such that all inferences are based on 4000 iterations. We ensured that the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic [@gelman1992inference] $\hat{R}\le 1.05$ for all variables in all models. In addition, traceplots for all variables were visually inspected and no anomalies were found.

## Achieved impedance as a moderator



## Frequentist analysis treating ordinal scales as metric variables

Even though we believe that our reported Bayesian analyses are much more suitable for the analysis of ordinal-scale data [@liddell2018analyzing] we also report standard frequentist analyses that do not take the ordinal scale into account. We do this mostly of a desire to convince the reader that we did not cherry-pick our analysis method to achieve a particular result. Simple independent t-tests comparing sham vs. anodal stimulation find significant effects both for subjects guessing the stimulation condition ($t(185.9)=-2.38, p=0.018, d=0.34$) and skin sensations ($t(189.03)=-2.0, p=0.047, d=0.29$). The effect of actual stimulation condition on guessing stimulation condition is significant also when including lab-location in a 2 (sham vs. anodal) $\times$ 3 (lab: GOE, TRM, AMS) ANOVA, $F(1,186)=5.74, p=0.018, \eta^2=0.03$. In this analysis, neither the main effect of lab ($F(2,186)=2.67, p=0.07, \eta^2=0.028$) or the lab $\times$ stimulation interaction were significant ($F(2,186)=0.25, p=0.78, \eta^2=0.003$). A corresponding ANOVA with reported skin-sensations as dependent variable also showed stronger sensations during anodal stimulation ($F(1,186)=4.31, p=0.039, \eta^2=0.023$). For this question, the main effect of lab was significant ($F(2,186)=8.46, p=0.00030, \eta^2=0.083$) but the interaction between lab and stimulation was not, $F(2,186)=0.94, p=0.39, \eta^2=0.01$.
