We hereby submit our manuscript "Blinding is compromised for transcranial direct current stimulation at 1 mA for 20 minutes in young healthy adults" for consideration for publication in *European Journal of Neuroscience* as a Short Communication. Given the technical nature of our contribution, we were also considering to submit the MS as a Technical Spotlight. We would kindly ask the editor to consider which format would be the better fit to our MS.

In our study, we analyzed data from what we think is the largest single brain-stimulation to-date (N=192; Boayue et al., in press, EJN) in order to test whether the popular "fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out" (FSF) protocol for sham stimulation is actually capable of maintaining proper blinding with standard stimulation settings (1 mA over 20 minutes above pre-frontal sites). Contrary to previous findings and the large literature employing this protocol, we find that our subjects were, to a degree, capable of distinguishing real from sham stimulation. This has strong implications both for interpreting previously collected data and for planning future investigations using this protocol.

We hope you will find our submission to be suitable for publication in the *European Journal of Neuroscience*.
