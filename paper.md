# Introduction

Low-intensity transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method, which applies direct current between two or more electrodes placed over the scalp. TDCS is typically applied at intensities between 1 and 2 mA, which induces mild to moderate amount of adverse-effects in most of the participants (Poreisz 2007). These adverse-effects include cutaneous discomfort (eg., itching, tingling, piercing, stinging, burning sensations) (Fertonani 2015) and redness underneath the electrodes (O’Connel 2012; Palm 2014) [@palm2014role]. 

Most studies use active sham stimulation protocol for placebo control. The aim of the active sham stimulation is to induce adverse-effects that are reminiscent of the real tDCS protocol without inducing the neurophysiologically relevant primary effects and after-effects. The most frequently applied active sham stimulation is the so called 'fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out' (FSF) protocol (Ambrus 2012), which maintains effective blinding depending on the intensity and the duration of the real tDCS protocol. Accumulating evidence indicate that the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol is more effective when the real tDCS is applied at lower intensities and for shorter stimulation durations. For instance, the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol is already compromised when 10 or 20 min of tDCS is applied at 1.5 mA (Kessler 2012). Likewise, effective double-blinding cannot be achieved by the FSF protocol for 20 or 30 min of 2 mA tDCS (O’Connel 2012; Russo 2013; Wallace 2016). 

Based on the literature, one may expect that 20 min of 1 mA tDCS can be effectively blinded by the FSF protocol. However, this assumption is based on a single study including 24 healthy volunteers and 23 chronic stroke patients with a mean age between 46.3 and 62.3 years (Gandiga 2006). Recent evidence also indicates that the tDCS-induced discomfort may depend on the age, and it is lower in older than in younger participants (Wallace 2016). This difference in the sensitivity may lead to the possibility that younger volunteers could better distinguish between real and active sham stimulation protocols than older participants, which could compromise effective blinding in younger adults. Given that large number of tDCS studies recruits young adults, we retrospectively analyze the subjective reports of 192 volunteers, who either received 20 min of real tDCS at 1 mA (n=96) or an active sham FSF protocol (n=96). Our findings challenge the present notion about the blinding efficacy of the FSF for 20 min of 1 mA tDCS in healthy, young volunteers.


# Material and methods

## Participants
In total, 192 participants were recruited (n female, mean age: x $\pm$ y) for the study, which was a preregistered report to study the behavioral effects of tDCS on mind-wandering. Participants were free of any neurological or psychiatric disorders and had no previous experience with tDCS. The study was approved by the local ethic committee and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before participation. 

## Stimulation protocols

The stimulation was delivered by a neuroConn DC-stimulator. The anode electrode (4 $\times$ 4 cm) was placed over the F3 location (according to the international 10/20 EEG system), whereas the cathode (7 $\times$ 5 cm) over the right supraorbital region. The electrodes were held in place by using the Ten/20 conductive electrode paste (Weaver and Company, USA) and elastic bandage.

The real tDCS protocol lasted for 20 min of continuous stimulation at 1 mA, whereas the FSF protocol for 15s at 1 mA. In addition, we utilized 30s-long fade-in/out periods at the beginning and at the end of both tDCS protocols. The stimulator was operating in study mode and the active sham the real stimulation protocols were assigned to pseudo-codes B and C, respectively. The display window of the stimulator was covered 30s after the start of the stimulation by a non-transparent material. The stimulation was administered in a double-blind fashion. Participants performed a cognitive task (Sustained Attention to Response Task) while receiving the stimulation. 

## Assessing the stimulation discomfort and the blinding efficacy

A 7-point Likert-scale was used to assess the amount of discomfort and the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol. For the discomfort, participants received the question “Please rate to what extent did you find the electrodes disturbing during the experiment (eg., cold or wet, tingling or itching)?” (1: not at all - 7: very strong). For the blinding efficacy, participants received the question “What do you think, did you receive real or sham/control stimulation?”  (1: definitely sham - 7: definitely real). The questionnaires were filled out at the end of the experiment.
