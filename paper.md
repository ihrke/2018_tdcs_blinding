# Introduction

Low-intensity transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method, which applies direct current between two or more electrodes placed over the scalp [@antal2017low]. TDCS is typically applied at intensities between 1 and 2 mA, which induces mild to moderate amount of adverse-effects in most of the participants [@poreisz2007safety; @matsumoto2017adverse]. These adverse-effects include cutaneous discomfort (eg., itching, tingling, piercing, stinging, burning sensations) [@fertonani2015you] and vasodilatation-induced redness underneath the electrodes [@durand2002vasodilatation; @o2012rethinking; @palm2014role; @ezquerro2017influence].

Most tDCS studies use active sham stimulation protocols for placebo control [@davis2013challenges]. The aim of the active sham stimulation is to induce adverse-effects that are reminiscent of the real tDCS protocol without inducing the neurophysiologically relevant primary effects and after-effects [@woods2016technical]. The most frequently applied active sham stimulation is the so called 'fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out' (FSF) protocol [@ambrus2012fade], which maintains effective blinding depending on the intensity and the duration of the real tDCS protocol. Accumulating evidence indicate that the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol is more effective when the real tDCS is applied at lower intensities and for shorter stimulation durations. For instance, the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol is already compromised when 10 or 20 min of tDCS is applied at 1.5 mA [@kessler2012differences]. Likewise, effective double-blinding cannot be achieved by the FSF protocol for 20 or 30 min of 2 mA tDCS [@o2012rethinking; @russo2013perception; @wallace2016perceived]. 

Based on the literature, one may expect that 20 min of 1 mA tDCS can be effectively blinded by the FSF protocol. However, this assumption is based on a single study including 24 healthy volunteers and 23 chronic stroke patients with a mean age between 46.3 and 62.3 years [@gandiga2006transcranial]. Recent evidence also indicates that the tDCS-induced discomfort may depend on the age, and it is lower in older than in younger participants [@wallace2016perceived]. This difference in the sensitivity may lead to the possibility that younger volunteers could better distinguish between real and active sham stimulation protocols than older participants, which could compromise effective blinding in younger adults. Given that large number of tDCS studies recruits young adults, we retrospectively analyze the subjective reports of 192 volunteers, who either received 20 min of real tDCS at 1 mA (n=96) or an active sham FSF protocol (n=96). We use publicly available dataset from a pre-registered multi-center double-blind parallel group study, which investigated the behavioral effects of anodal vs. sham tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on mind-wandering [@boayue2018registered]. Our findings challenge the present notion about the blinding efficacy of the FSF for 20 min of 1 mA tDCS in healthy, young volunteers.


# Material and methods

## Participants 
Part of the publicly available dataset contains sujbective reports of 192 healthy participants (134 female, mean age: 22.2 yrs $\pm$ 3.19 yrs SD) [@boayue2018registered]. The raw data are available here (\textcolor{red}{todo: link}). Participants were free of any neurological or psychiatric disorders and had no previous experience with tDCS. The study was approved by the local ethic committee and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before participation. 

## Stimulation protocols

The stimulation was delivered by a neuroConn DC-stimulator. The anode electrode (4 $\times$ 4 cm) was placed over the F3 location (according to the international 10/20 EEG system), whereas the cathode (7 $\times$ 5 cm) over the right supraorbital region. The electrodes were held in place by using the Ten/20 conductive electrode paste (Weaver and Company, USA) and elastic bandage.

The real tDCS protocol lasted for 20 min of continuous stimulation at 1 mA, whereas the FSF protocol for 15s at 1 mA. In addition, we utilized 30s-long fade-in/out periods at the beginning and at the end of both tDCS protocols. The stimulator was operating in study mode: The active sham and the real stimulation protocols were assigned to pseudo-codes B and C, respectively. The display window of the stimulator was covered 30s after the start of the stimulation by a non-transparent material. The stimulation was administered in a double-blind fashion. Participants performed a cognitive task (Sustained Attention to Response Task) while receiving the stimulation. 

## Assessing the stimulation discomfort and the blinding efficacy

A 7-point Likert-scale was used to assess the amount of discomfort and the blinding efficacy of the FSF protocol used in this study. For the discomfort, participants received the question \textit{“Please rate to what extent did you find the electrodes disturbing during the experiment (eg., cold or wet, tingling or itching)?}”. Participants could provide their ratings between "not at all" (1) and "very strong" (7). For the blinding efficacy, participants received the question \textit{“What do you think, did you receive real or sham/control stimulation?”}. Participants could rate their answers between "definitely sham" (1) and "definitely real" (7). The questionnaires were filled out at the end of the experiment. 

## Analysis method

It has recently pointed out that treating ordinal variables, such as responses to Likert-scales, as metric can have a strong impact on the validity of the statistical analyses: It can distort effect-size estimates, inflate error rates and cause other problems [@liddell2018analyzing,@buerkner_vuorre_2018]. Despite these severe problems, treating ordinal variables as metric is extremely common in psychology and related disciplines [@liddell2018analyzing]. A more appropriate approach uses specific ordinal models such as ordinal probit regression [@buerkner_vuorre_2018]. Here we use a Bayesian approach to estimate such a model as implemented in the R-package `brms` [@buerkner_2018_brms]. We report our results in terms of posterior mean parameters along with the 95% highest-density interval (HDI) calculated from posterior distribution. This measure quantifies the interval in which the true parameter is located with 95% probability given the applied model. We conclude that a parameter is different from zero if the 95% interval excludes zero. We used the default priors implemented in the `brms`-package [@buerkner_2018_brms]. Those include uniform priors for all regression coefficients and a Students' t-prior centered at zero with df=3 and sd=10 for the thresholds.
In addition, we use Bayesian methods for model selection based on the leave-one-out crossvalidation procedure (LOO; @vehtari2017practical). The data analysis script used for this study is available here (\textcolor{red}{todo: link}).

# Results and Discussion

\color{red} Results and interpretation comes here. \color{black}

Our results are summarized graphically in figure @fig:results. Regarding the blinding efficacy, excluding subjects who were undecided, there were 2.6 as many subjects in the real stimulation group who guessed that they received real stimulation (52 with scores $>4$ vs. 20 with scores $<4$). In contrast, this figure was only 1.19 for the sham group (38 with scores $>4$ vs. 32 with scores $<4$). We submitted these responses for guessing stimulation condition to an ordinal regression models using lab and actual stimulation condition as predictors. We found that the effect of real stimulation was reliable ($b=0.35$, HDI=$[0.06, 0.65]$). This effect was robust against different choices of the analysis method (see Supplemental Analysis). While including lab as a factor was preferred by model-selection criteria, there was no clear effect for generally higher or lower scores across labs ($b_{\text{GOE}}=0.33 [-0.03, 0.69]$, $b_{\text{TRM}}=-0.10 [-0.45,0.28]$). The findings for the discomfort question were similar. In a parallel model, real stimulation had a positive effect ($b=0.34 [0.04, 0.63]$). In addition, subjects in both Göttingen and Tromsø reported more discomfort when compared to Amsterdam (b_{\text{GOE}}=0.43 [0.05, 0.80]$, $b_{\text{TRM}}=0.67 [0.31,1.06]$). 



\color{red} These are just possible topics for the discussion, in case we are within the word limit: \color{black} 

Most studies that recruite healthy participants investigate the effects of single-session tDCS. In parallel-group studies, single-session refers to the notion that participants receive either real or active sham tDCS once, whereas in cross-over studies, participants receive both stimulation types once in a randomized or counterbalanced order. In healthy participants, exposure to both real and active sham tDCS increases the probability of correct guessings about the stimulation type already on the second session [@o2012rethinking]. In line with this, Ambrus and colleagues have shown that participants who have prior experience with tDCS judge the stimulation type more accurately than those participants who had no prior experience with tDCS [@ambrus2010cutaneous]. Here we have shown that young, healthy participants can corectly judge the stimulation type above chance in a single-session, parallel-group tDCS study. The accuracy of identifying the stimulation type may depend on the study cohort and might not necessarily be related to the stimulation induced cutaneous discomfort [@brunoni2014comparison].  

The FSF in only one type of protocol in the family of active sham stimulation for tDCS. New forms of real tDCS protocols that use higher stimualtion intensities, longer stimulation durations and higher number but smaller diameter electrodes inevitably pushes the field to develop and improve the efficacy of active sham protocols for tDCS. Palm and collegues introduced low-intensity pulsating active sham protocol, in which 100-200 mA amplitude pulses are applied at every 400-550 ms, which is a promising protocol for low-intensity but longer-lasting real tDCS protocols [@palm2013evaluation]. For higher stimulation intensities (e.g. 2 mA and above), one could use off-target, low-intensity control stimulation (e.g., at 0.5 mA) to decrease the perceived differences in the induced cutaneous sensations [@brunye2014mitigating]. Whereas the aim of the active sham protocol is to induce cutaneous sensations indistinguishable from the real tDCS, an alternative approach may focus to reduce the tDCS-induced cutaneous sensations by applying topical anesthesia [@mcfadden2011reducing; @guleyupoglu2014reduced; @guarienti2015reducing].
